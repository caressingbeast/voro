# voro

> Mock smarter, not harder.

**Voro** helps developers build confidently before APIs are ready. It makes it easy to mock data, generate schemas, and serve fake endpoints — all from the types you already have.

---

## ✨ Goals

- **Type-first development**  
  Use your existing TypeScript or Zod types as the single source of truth. No duplication, no guessing.

- **Mock data, fast**  
  Generate realistic mock data instantly, for use in development, testing, Storybook, and more.

- **Local mock API server**  
  Spin up a local API that mimics your future backend — perfect for parallelizing frontend and backend work.

- **No backend? No problem.**  
  Ideal for teams working in design systems, UI-first workflows, or prototyping without a backend in place.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Frontend development shouldn't be blocked by unfinished APIs or slow backend cycles. Voro aims to empower frontend teams to move independently — without sacrificing correctness or confidence.

## 📍 Name

Voro is short, fast, and flexible — just like the kind of dev experience we want to create.
